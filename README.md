# Sophie's scripts & dotfiles

You know the deal by now, there's a million of these repos.

Some things to remember:
- `.config/labwc/autostart`
    - Aside from all the programs it runs, it also relies on:
- `scripts/screenres`
    - Very machine-specific script. A necessary evil with labwc. These two are
    coupled, keep that in mind.
- `.config/weechat`
    - Don't copy me in mirroring this if you don't know what you're doing. Peep
    the .gitignore or get your data stolen.
- `.config/fontconfig/conf.d/70-noto-cjk.conf`
    - I borrowed this from the Arch wiki. It was written by Akiiru. I wanted to
    put credit as a comment in the file, but fontconfig doesn't like that.

Many scripts are specific to my setup, but can be easily adapted to others. Feel
free to do so.
